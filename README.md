on/off 8 things  
 
THING a) meaningful for human b) bits on machine    
1 ON/off: input/output options (under url for example)   
2 time: WHEN on chronological number (upon enter)   
3 hash: WHERE on cryptographic fingerprint   
4 url: while on internet    
5 sig: WHO enters thing   
6 memory: HOW save/find thing      
7 program: DO things   
8 things: DEFINE

ON/OFF text input/output (on browser extension)   
a TAG input keyword(s) to find find thing     
b COMMENT say something, ask question, etc    
c CLIPBOARD link thing to tags/comments/etc    
d OO option/options offer action game   
e BET some thing ,more,less
f WEN expiry future time when game over   
g PLAYERS when who play what wen      
h PLAY program future action game   

^

TIME: on enter say when    
a unix timestamp    
b for player (on thing while signed) // ,less precise on single player      
c for players (,milli,nano,micro,pico,femto) // ,more precise on more players     
d on toggle unix,yyyymmddhhss,now // same time, see different ways    
e show/hide time for thing   

^

HASH fingerprint when what enters   
a unique collision-free namespace describe, make do    
b sha-256 for now    
c shortcut options   
d migration to better hashspace   
e show/hide hash for thing event when what happens   

^

URL    
a if url, include on thing+time+hash     
b copy content to own memory, offline option  
c copy thing to alt url eg archive.is  
d clean thing before copy  

^

SIG   
a sign thing with public/private key     
b make public/private easier (fail better)      
c one password make player own things easier <!-- less scatter splatter -->      
d use weapons-grade cryptography      
e be sovereign   

^

MEMORY hold/find things easier    
a find in time   
b find in hash    
c find on tag, url, grep in comments/text   
d find by sig, while players share thing   
e have in one "1" database per player thing   
e hold in phsyical memory thing   

^

PROGRAM: things on memory compute network(s)   
a know how who has what where when then   
b compute offline option on    
c trust own computer    
d copy to other computer option on/off   
e not  

^

things: DEFINE   
a word, human superpower (no computer needed)   
b machine amplify word power (for good, or not)   
c future program things    
- oo option/options   
- need/want things   
- list of lists thing
- more,less say HOW MUCH of thing  <!-- <more less> slider thing   
- comma,nospace options|option  <!-- tangle-like options in plain text syntax -->   
- more players faster game  
- better,more players switch  
- player,user switch   <!-- own game thing -->
- "1" one database for things thing   
- one way past/future timeline thing <!-- proof of up only -->     
- timechain for player, ledger   <!-- log things -->
- copy or not, sync to chain option   <!-- own memory thing -->
- copynot: proof of delete thing   <!-- new superpower thing -->
- web of trust thing  <!-- anon ok -->  
- text enhance thing <!-- superhypertext -->   
- picture things   <!-- pix8 -->
- GIF things   <!-- ggif -->
- too many things   
- gitcoin things   
- AI things   
- 3D phone thing   <!-- box8 -->
- AR projection thing   <!-- projection8 -->  
- his thing   
- her thing  
- sort good things    
- your thing here thing

from trying failing to compute stuff, now to fail better:

computer stuff is hard, especially for smooth brains.. 

,make it easier,make it stop < options action game

finding stuff is hard, scatter splatter over time across apps devices paths names

web123 they all want your memory on their platform why? who wins?

"decentralize" fr on god srsly to the max, how?

if memory on base of compute/network stack then:

make easy for player to own control, find own memory in own namespace ie   

1) objective names computers automate like timestamp and hash

2) subjective names humans make for things player wants to save

make/find things faster better easier  

and..

BE PRACTICAL

while memory is held physically (hodl in wallet like private device) then computer more

a) fast

b) private

c) secure

d) mobile

and..

BE LEGAL

1) possession is 9/10 of the law: own your data physically in your own memory  

2) 4th amendment privacy rights: while memory is not copied to network, physical privacy

3) tort rights: if violation of (1) or (2) then (3) offensive rights to claim damages

so..

on memory, compute offline then copy to network or not

on law, know your rights and use them

OWN

math superpowers for weapons-grade cryptographic sovereignty and

physics superpowers by having,holding physical thing and

time dimension constraint limit
